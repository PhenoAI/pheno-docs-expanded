### Dataset: 002-anthropometrics.md
# Anthropometrics dataset  

Anthropometrics is an important tool in the field of medicine, as it allows for the assessment of a person's health and nutritional status, as well as the identification of potential health risks.

Anthropometric measurements can be used to assess the body composition of adults, which can help to identify potential health risks such as sarcopenia (age-related loss of muscle mass) or obesity. In a clinical setting, anthropometric measurements are typically used in combination with other medical tests and evaluations to provide a more complete picture of a person's health. For example, a doctor may use anthropometric measurements in combination with blood tests and imaging studies to assess a person's nutrition status, or to identify potential health risks such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Additionally, these measurements may be used to help monitor the effectiveness of treatment interventions, such as weight loss programs, and to track changes in a person's health over time.
Measurement protocol
Our anthropometric measurements include height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and neck circumference. The equipment used in this protocol includes a measuring tape and a scale, specifically a Shekel stadiometer (Shekel Ultrasonic Physician BMI Scale h 120-4).

For measuring height, participants are asked to stand with their face against the scale, legs parallel to each other, toes pointing forward, and soles flat on the floor. Ensure participant's posture is unsupported, to stand as tall as possible, completely standing on the scale with legs straight. The height is recorded in centimeters.

For measuring weight, the participant is asked to remove their shoes and excess clothing, and stand on the stadiometer. The weight is recorded in kilograms. The measurement protocol for the waist, hip, and neck circumference include specific instructions for standing position, and the use of measuring tape. All circumference measurements are recorded in centimeters.

### Data availability:
The information is stored in 1 parquet file: `anthropometrics.parquet`


### Dataset: 003-fundus.md
# Fundus images dataset  

Fundus imaging allows for the visualization of the interior surface of the eye, known as the fundus; and used to examine structures such as the optic disc, retina, and retinal microvasculature. This procedure is commonly used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye diseases.

Fundus imaging is a type of medical imaging technique that is used to obtain detailed, high-resolution images of the back of the eye, including the retina, the optic nerve, and the macula, an oval-shaped area in the center of the retina used for central vision. These images can provide important information about the health of the eye and can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye diseases and conditions.

One of the key features that can be seen in fundus images is the retinal microvasculature, which refers to the network of small blood vessels that supply blood to the retina. The appearance and structure of the retinal microvasculature can provide information about the health of the eye and can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of conditions.

In addition, the information provided by fundus imaging can also be used in research to better understand the underlying mechanisms of various eye conditions and as a non-invasive tool for visualization of the general microvascular circulation health and a direct view to part of the central nervous system. As such, the fundus image can serve as a window to systemic health. 

The Human Phenotype Project (HPP) performs fundus imaging on each participant's eyes to produce image files. To process and enhance the data, an open source software pipeline: AutoMorph: Automated Retinal Vascular Morphology Quantification via a Deep Learning Pipeline (Zhou 2022), that combines several different deep learning models is used. Specifically for the following steps:
(1) Image pre-processing.
(2) Image quality grading.
(3) Anatomical segmentation (binary vessel segmentation, artery/vein segmentation, and optic disc segmentation).
(4) Various morphological feature measurements such as vessel caliber, tortuosity density, fractal dimension etc. These features were calculated separately for segmented veins and arteries, and also as a combined feature.
The current pipeline does not include automatic identification or clinical interpretation of eye abnormalities such as age-macular degeneration (AMD) or edema, glaucoma signs, microaneurysms etc’ that can be derived from the fundus image.

### Data availability:

- All tabular information is stored in a main parquet file: `fundus.parquet`
- Derived microvasculature information is stored in a secondary parquet file: `microvasculature.parquet`
- Image files including segmentations are stored in subfolders and mapped in the parqet files.

### Dataset: 004-liver_ultrasound.md
# Liver ultrasound dataset  

Liver ultrasound was performed using the Supersonic Aixplorer MACH 30 (Hologic, USA).  The Supersonic Imagine Aixplorer is an ultrasound device that is able to measure the liver's stiffness, viscosity, attenuation and sound speed to diagnose and monitor liver conditions such as steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. The device uses several ultrasound-based measures, including Speed of Sound (SSp.PLUS), Attenuation Index (Att.PLUS), Viscosity (Vi.PLUS) and Elasticity (Two-Dimensional ShareWave Elastography (2D-SWE)) to evaluate the liver and improve diagnosis performance. These measurements have been shown to be correlated to different stages of liver conditions.

Ultrasound-based liver measurements were performed using ShearWave Elastography (2D- SWE.PLUS) for elasticity assessment, sound speed Plane-wave ultrasound and attenuation. Plane-wave ultrasound was measured for assessment of liver steatosis (fatness) and viscosity plane-wave ultrasound for assessment of viscosity as a marker of inflammation. Measurements were performed with a C6-1X convex transducer using the UltraFast software available on the Mach 30 ultrasound system. US images of the liver were also saved.

Measurement protocol: All patients were examined in supine position, with the right arm elevated above the head, by an intercostal approach, in the right liver lobe. Acquisitions were performed during neutral respiratory apnea. Initially the Attenuation and Speed of Sound were measured from a homogeneous area of the liver parenchyma free of vessels or other structures. Measurements were performed from 3 different liver regions. 2D-SWE and viscosity were then measured from 3 different locations in an area of relative uniform elasticity, at a depth of 3–5 cm using stability index tool (SI) derived from the spatial and temporal stiffness stability at a stability index >90%. 

### Data availability:
The information is stored in 2 parquet files: `liver_ultrasound.parquet`and `liver_ultrasound_aggregated.parquet`

### Dataset: 005-diet_logging.md
# Diet logging dataset  

Diet logging through a smartphone app encompasses the detailed recording of food and beverage intake. This includes specifics such as the varieties of food consumed, portion sizes, nutritional components, and the timing of meals. By tracking these dietary patterns, individuals can monitor their own eating habits, while researchers can use the aggregated data to gain valuable insights into broader dietary trends within a population. Furthermore, this information can be correlated with other time-based measurements and occurrences to yield a more comprehensive understanding of health and nutrition.

### Data availability:
The information is stored in 3 parquet files: `diet_logging.parquet`, `diet_logging_events.parquet`,  `raw_diet_logging_events.parquet `which contains summary information, processed diet logging data and raw diet logging data respectively.

### Dataset: 006-hand_grip.md
# Hand grip strength dataset  
Hand grip strength (HGS) is an effective marker of general health in middle age and older adulthood. Grip strength is measured by squeezing a type of muscle strength testing equipment, known as a dynamometer.

HGS is a measure of the maximum force that an individual can exert with their hand. It is a widely used measure of muscular strength. HGS is an easy and quick measure to obtain.

In a clinical setting, HGS is often used as a measure to assess changes in muscle strength over time. For example, in patients with conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or sarcopenia, Additionally, HGS can be used to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs, such as those used to recover from a stroke or other neurological condition.

HGS is measured using a Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer. The measurement is a measure of the static force (without movement) that the hand can exert when squeezing around the dynamometer.

### Data availability:
The information is stored in 1 parquet file: `hand_grip.parquet`

### Dataset: 007-blood_pressure.md
# Blood pressure dataset  
Blood pressure is the measurement of the force exerted against the walls of the arteries as blood flows through them. Blood pressure is recorded as two values: systolic pressure (the pressure when the heart beats) and diastolic pressure (the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats).

Blood pressure measurement can be performed in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and even at home, using an automated or manual sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure measurement can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment interventions, such as lifestyle changes. The goal of treatment is to achieve and maintain target blood pressure levels, which are generally lower for individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular disease. 

Blood pressure is measured using an OMRON Blood Pressure Monitor HEM-RML31 device and an appropriately sized cuff. Multiple blood pressure readings are done during the visit. For each blood pressure reading, three measurements are taken: systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and average heart rate. The participant is asked to avoid caffeine, exercise and smoking at least 30 minutes before the measurement. The measurement is taken on the left arm if possible.

### Dataset: 008-serum_lipidomics.md
# Serum lipidomics dataset  

High throughput untargeted lipidomics in serum by Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization High-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS).

The serum metabolome is known to represent a variety of environmental, genetic and other endogenous factors (Bar et al. 2020). Lipidomics is a subfield of metabolomics, which is defined as the study of pathways and networks of cellular lipids in biological systems. Lipids perform various functions within the body, from structural components of cell membranes, to energy reserve and regulating hormones. These pivotal functions highlight circulating lipids as playing a key role in a number of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke (Holmes et al. 2018; Michos et al. 2019).

### Dataset: 009-sleep.md
# Sleep monitoring dataset  

Sleep monitoring includes sleep staging, body positioning, respiratory events, heart rate, oxygen saturation and snoring, measured concurrently over three nights.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder in which a person’s breathing is interrupted during sleep due to obstruction of the upper airway as a result of relaxation of the throat muscles. This obstruction can lead to pauses in breathing for short periods of time, which can cause loud snoring, reduction in the  blood oxygen levels, stress response, awakening and fragmented sleep.

A home sleep apnea test (HSAT) is a non-invasive test used to diagnose sleep apnea. During an HSAT, a patient wears a portable device overnight to monitor their breathing, heart rate, oxygen levels, snoring, and other sleep patterns. The device records this data and it is then analyzed by clinically-validated algorithms that compute apnea-related indices. The data can also be used to study sleep architecture and other aspects of sleep, such as heart rate variability (HRV) and arrhythmia.

The device used for sleep monitoring in the Human Phenotype Project is the FDA-approved WatchPAT-300 by Itamar Medical. This device contains 5 sensors: An actigraph worn on the wrist; a pulse oximeter and a Peripheral Arterial Tone (PAT) probe worn on the finger; and a microphone and accelerometer worn on the chest for respiratory effort, snoring and body position measurement.

The device's algorithms provide 3 main indices for diagnosis of OSA: Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI), Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI). The device's algoithms also provide indices for diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation (not FDA-approved yet): Premature beats per minute, Atrial fibrillation longest event.

The WatchPAT device is given to participants during the visit to the clinical testing center who then record 3 nights of sleep at home during the following two weeks (Figure 4). The recorded tested nights should reflect the usual sleeping regimen / typical bedtime (for example, not after exceeding alcohol consumption).

### Data availability:
The information is stored in 2 main statistics parquet files: `sleep.parquet`, `hrv.parquet`; In multiple events parquets and in multiple time series parquets / EDF files containing sensor channels for each night of logging.

### Dataset: 010-peripheral_vascular_health.md
# Peripheral vascular health dataset  

ABI and PWV are measured in the Human Phenotype Project to assess vascular health. ABI is a ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the arm. PWV is the speed at which the pulse wave of the blood pressure travels along the wall of an artery or a combined length of arteries.

### ABI
Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) measurements were conducted using the Falcon (Viasonix, Israel) device while subjects were in supine position. During the ABI test, primary systolic pressures are measured in each of the right and left brachial arteries, and right and left ankles. ABI is determined as the ratio between the brachial systolic pressure and the ankle pressure on each side providing ABI values per each side. The systolic pressures were based on a combination of blood pressure cuffs and blood flow reading with photoplethysmograph (PPG) sensors placed on the measured limb fingers.  Under normal circumstances, the blood pressure in the ankle will be very similar or identical to that measured in the arm, so the measured ABI value will be close to 1. In the case of peripheral arterial disease, there will be a discrepancy - the blood pressure at the ankle will be lower than the blood pressure in the arms. This will indicate insufficiency in the arteries that carry blood to the legs. In the general population, PAD affects about 10% of people over the age of 55.

### PWV
Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is considered a surrogate marker for arterial stiffness/elasticity, which is correlated with vascular disease (REF). Vascular elasticity is important for the normal vascular function for attenuation and smoothing of the pulsation intensity and blood flow. With age, and in combination with atherosclerosis processes, blood vessels may lose their elasticity and become stiff. Increased arterial stiffness can predict future vascular system problems.The contractions of the heart generate arterial blood pressure pulse waves which propagate through the arterial walls. PWV is defined as the velocity at which these arterial blood pressure pulses propagate. PWV is a quantitative parameter reflecting arterial stiffness. Higher PWV values reflect greater than normal arterial stiffness. 
While there is no one set standard of how or where to measure PWV, some of the more common PWV measurements include the baPWV, which reflects the pulse wave propagation between the brachial and ankle, cfPWV reflecting propagation between the carotid and femoral, and faPWV also know as leg PWV reflecting the PWV along the leg between the femoral and ankle.
In the HPP we measure leg PWV (faPWV). PWV is highly dependent on the method of measurement, as well as on the measurement sites. Therefore, typical values for baPWV differ from faPWV and cfPWV.
Based on literature reports, normal PWV values can range between around 6 m/s to 14 m/s, depending on the method of measurement, location and the patient’s age. For example, according to Laurent et al.  the PWV increases from 4–5 m/s in the ascending aorta to 5–6 m/s in the abdominal aorta then 8–9 m/s in the iliac and femoral arteries (Laurent et al. European Heart Journal (2006) 27, 2588–2605)

PWV has been recognized as an indicator of organ damage and a useful additional test in the investigation of high blood pressure, it is also a useful method for prediction of cardiovascular events and mortality. Studies have also shown that ABI is a reliable predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease.

### Dataset: 011-body_composition.md
# Body composition (DXA) dataset  

Body composition was profiled based on DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) imaging, and includes measurements of fat and lean mass for the legs, arms, trunk, gynoid, and android, as well as measurements of total scan visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area, mass and volume are included.

DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) is a medical imaging technique that is used to measure body composition, specifically the amounts of bone, fat, and lean muscle tissue in the body. A DXA scan uses a low dose of ionizing radiation to produce a detailed image of the body, which is then analyzed by a software to determine the body composition. This method is considered to be one of the most accurate methods for measuring body composition, as it is able to distinguish between different types of tissue and provide detailed information about the distribution of fat and muscle in the body. DXA imaging is commonly used for assessing bone density and for monitoring changes in body composition over time, such as during weight loss, muscle building programs or for assessment of sarcopenia.

### Dataset: 012-carotid_ultrasound.md
# Carotid ultrasound dataset  

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement is an ultrasound-based technique used to assess the thickness of the innermost two layers of the carotid artery, known as the intima and media. These layers can become thickened due to atherosclerotic processes or due to age. The thickening of the intima-media layer can be throughout the length of the artery (increased IMT) or as local accumulation of fatty deposits that penetrate into the vessel interior known  as plaques. Advanced plaques can cause stenosis of the artery. Carotid IMT is increasingly used as an indicator of early atherosclerosis and a predictor for cardiovascular events and can be used for identifying asymptomatic patients at high risk who might be candidates for more intensive medical interventions. Measurement of CIMT with B-mode ultrasound is a noninvasive, sensitive, and reproducible technique for identifying and quantifying subclinical vascular disease and for evaluating CVD risk.

The ultrasound probe is placed on the skin over the carotid artery and high-frequency sound waves are used to produce images of the artery. These images are then analyzed using an automatic detection algorithm to measure the thickness of the intima and media layers. 

Measurement protocol: Carotid US was performed using the Supersonic Aixplorer MACH 30 (Hologic, USA). Carotid Intima Media (CIMT) was measured using the L10-2 transducer from both carotid arteries while the subject in supine position with head rotated to the opposite side of the measured artery. Evaluation was performed using an automatic computerized system (Aixplorer Mach 30). The intima and media are automatically traced within the box of interest. Mean CIMT was recorded over a length of 1 cm at the far wall of each carotid artery. One measurement was obtained from each carotid artery. Only parts of the carotid artery without plaques were included in the IMT analysis.

### Dataset: 013-gut_microbiome.md
# Gut microbiome dataset  

Metagenomics is the study of genetic material from environmental samples, including microbial communities. It involves sequencing the DNA of all microorganisms in the sample, rather than isolating individual organisms. Metagenomics enables the identification and functional analysis of microorganisms in diverse environments, including soil, water, and the human body.

This dataset maps out the human gut microbiota per participant via shotgun metagenomic sequencing given stool samples. It is then compared to known references of gut flora to measure prevalence of specific microbes.

Gut microbiome metagenomics can be used to identify potential biomarkers of disease, develop personalized treatment strategies, and better understand the complex relationship between the gut microbiota and human physiology. It has already been providing insights into the role of gut microbes in various diseases such as obesity, diabetes and IBD.

To measure the genetic makeup of the human gut flora given stool samples via metagenomics, the following steps done:

1. Collection of stool sample: For each visit, a stool sample is collected from the individual and stored appropriately to preserve the microbial community.
2. DNA extraction: DNA is extracted from the stool sample using specialized techniques to isolate the microbial DNA from other materials present in the sample.
3. DNA fragmentation and sequencing: The extracted DNA is then fragmented into small pieces and sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies.
4. Quality control: The resulting raw sequencing data is then pre-processed, removing low-quality reads and artifacts of the sequencing methodology.
5. Taxonomic classification: The processed sequencing data is then compared to databases of known microbial sequences to identify and classify the microbial species presence and their respective abundances in the sample.

### Data availability:
The information is stored in multiple parquet files:

- `gut_microbiome.parquet`: Sequencing and QC statistics.
- `urs`: Segal Lab relative abundance.
- `metaphlan_*`: 8 tables with MetaPhlAn 4 relative abundances, separated by taxonomic levels.

### Dataset: 022-bone_density.md
# Bone size, mineral and density (DXA) dataset  

Bone density was profiled based on DXA imaging, and includes measurements of mineral content in different parts of a variety of skeletal components.

DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) imaging is a method used to measure bone density and mineral content. A DXA scan uses a low dose of ionizing radiation to produce a detailed image of the body, specifically the bones. The scan is then analyzed by a software to determine the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in different parts of the body. This method is considered to be one of the most accurate methods for measuring bone density, as it is able to provide detailed information about the distribution of bone mineral content in different bony structures of the body skeleton. The spine and hip are most commonly measured because that is where most osteoporotic fractures occur. DXA imaging is commonly used for assessing the risk of osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone density and increased risk of fractures, and for monitoring the effects of treatments for the condition.

### Dataset: 024-rna_seq.md
# RNA-Seq dataset

The RNA-Seq dataset includes bulk gene expression profiles measured in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cells, sampled at each visit to the clinical testing center.

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful high-throughput technique used to analyze the transcriptome, providing a snapshot of RNA presence and quantity in a biological sample at a given moment. Our bulk approach sequences RNA from a mixed population of cells, giving a cumulative overview of gene expression across the sample. It's widely used for understanding complex biological processes and disease mechanisms.

This RNA-Seq dataset focuses on gene expression profiles in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), collected during patient visits to a clinical testing center. The aim is to uncover the gene expression dynamics in PBMCs under various clinical conditions. PBMCs, which include lymphocytes and monocytes, play a key role in the immune response. The gene expression patterns in these cells can provide valuable insights into immune system activities and pathophysiological states.

The dataset was generated using 3’-tagged bulk RNA sequencing technology, capturing a broad spectrum of gene expression in PBMCs from diverse clinical samples. The protocol was adapted from mcSCRB-seq The library preparation for our RNA-Seq dataset is based on a 3'-tagged bulk RNA-Sequencing protocol, adapted from mcSCRB-seq (Bagnoli et al.). This method incorporates unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), pool barcodes, and sample barcodes. UMIs are crucial for accurately quantifying transcript abundance, as they enable the differentiation of PCR duplicates from unique mRNA molecules. Pool barcodes facilitate multiplexing of several samples in a single sequencing run, enhancing throughput efficiency.

# Oral microbiome dataset  

The primary intent behind collecting buccal swabs was to explore human genetics. Concurrently, it yielded metagenomic data, unveiling the microbial community within the oral cavity. 

This data illuminates the diversity and interactions of microorganisms, specifically in the buccal mucosa. Delving into the oral microbiome presents an opportunity to understand its linkage to health conditions. For instance, an imbalanced oral microbiome can lead to periodontal disease, associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, alterations in the oral microbiome have been observed in oral cancers, hinting at its potential role in their onset and progression​ [The oral microbiome: diversity, biogeography and human health](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-023-00963-6)​. 

Through this data, the exploration into possible connections between oral microbial composition and various health conditions is facilitated, marking a step towards understanding the broader health implications.
