## Description

Study core datasets form the foundational structure of the Human Phenotype Project, containing essential participant demographics and study event information. These datasets provide the framework for linking all other data types and understanding the study's longitudinal structure.

## Introduction

Every research study requires a well-organized data structure that tracks participants, study events, and basic demographic information. The study core datasets serve as the backbone of the Human Phenotype Project, enabling researchers to understand who participated, when they participated, and what assessments were completed. This information is critical for data integration, longitudinal analysis, and understanding the representativeness of the study population.

## Available Datasets

- **[Population](datasets/000-population.html)** - Core participant demographics, enrollment information, and study status
